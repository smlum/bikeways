# Workflow

This document explains the intended workflow to create a new LODE dataset.

## What are LODE datasets?

LODE datasets are collections of geospatial data collected from open data sources in Canada. They are grouped by domain (e.g. bikeways, pedestrian, healthcare facilities).

Some common characteristics are:

- They may include point, line, or polygon data. 
- They may ingest a data of variety of formats (e.g. geopackage, parquet, geojson, json, csv, shp).
- They require that all data be released under an open license (e.g. ODbL, CC-BY, CC0, etc).
- They generally aim to standardize the data to a common schema.

## Workflow overview

While each dataset has different needs, there are some common steps to each data processing workflow. 

A broad overview of the workflow is:

1. Collection
2. Inspection
3. Preprocessing (standardize columns, geometry, CRS, formatting, etc)
4. Classification 
5. Processing (filtering, assigning CSD, calculating lengths, merging, deduplication)
6. Validation
7. Data visualization
8. Dissemination 


## 1. Data collection

Providers live in `providers-directory/providers.csv`. Checklist + per-source files live in
`sources/` (`checklist.csv`, `<source_id>/metadata.yaml`); the tools that manage them are in
`lode/src/lode/tools/checklist/`.

**Workflow**
- `python sync_checklist.py` — builds/updates `checklist.csv` from `providers.csv`. Safe to
  re-run any time; never loses progress.
- `python web/server.py` (http://localhost:8642) — one tool, two things:
  - Browse each row's portal and record what you find: Found → `source_url`, Nothing → `checked`.
    `prior_url` (e.g. a 2024 CCND lead) is offered as a starting point but never overwritten by
    these actions, so a mistaken "not found" can't destroy it. As soon as a row is Found,
    `data/raw/<source_id>/` is created so there's somewhere to land the download.
  - Once found, the row's Metadata column lets you generate `sources/<source_id>/metadata.yaml`
    (deliberately on demand, not automatic) and fill in the rest (`format`, `raw_filename`,
    etc.) in a modal — including a "Detect" button that reads whatever you've dropped in
    `data/raw/<source_id>/` to prefill `format`/`raw_filename`.
- `python process_checklist.py` — just stamps `checked_date` for rows checked off by hand
  outside the UI (e.g. direct CSV edits). Never touches yaml.

**Notes**
- `checked`/`checked_date` are tracked distinctly from what was found, so future years know
  what's already been reviewed, not just what's been found so far.
- A provider with more than one dataset gets a duplicated checklist row, not a list column.
- `provider_id` must stay unique in `providers.csv` — when two distinct providers share a
  name (e.g. a city and the surrounding region/county), disambiguate with a suffix rather
  than merging them onto one id; it's also the basis for `source_id` and the
  `data/raw/<source_id>/` folder, so a collision there would collide downstream too.

## 2. Data inspection

**Input**
- Raw data files

**Output**
- Log file with report for each raw data file:
  - Number of rows
  - Loaded correctly
  - For each column:
    - Number of unique values
    - Type
    - Number of nulls
    - 3 sample points in a comma separated list (max 25 chars each)
  - Geometry
  - CRS
  - Formatting (UTF-8?)
- Column mapping file(s) (automated)
- Column mapping file(s) (manually reviewed and locked in)

**Workflow**
- Run a script that analyses raw data directory
- Review automated column mapping
- Generate manually verified or modified column mapping

## 3. Data preprocessing

**Input**
- Raw data files

**Output**
- Cleaned data files
  - Standardize format
  - Standardize column names (using column mapping from previous step)
  - Standardize geometry
  - Standardize CRS
  - Standardize formatting (UTF-8?)
  - Deal with special characters
  - Standardize nulls, blank spaces, etc
  - Basic deduplication (within files)
  - Assign ID (unique within a run only — not stable across years/vintages, segments can change)
- Log of results
  - Rows per file

**Workflow**
- Run script

## 4. Data classification

**Input**
- Cleaned data files
- Previous classification files (e.g. 2024 mapping)
- Classification rules config (project-specific, rules-based matching)

**Output**
- Automated classification mapping
- Reviewed/locked classification mapping

**Workflow**
- Script applies rules-based matching against source values → automated classification
- UI to inspect source values and verify/correct the automated mapping (this is `classification-review`, extended to drive initial assignment, not just post-hoc QA)
  - For all unique values of specified columns to be classified:
    - Number of rows
    - Calculated length (rough is fine)
    - Specified number of sample values (default 3)
    - Google Street View
    - Previous classification (if poss)
  - Manual review/correction where automated matching fails

**Notes**
- Source class may need multiple source columns combined to assign one target class (not always a single 1:1 column)
- May need to classify more than one target attribute — e.g. Can-BICS class and surface material/type — not just one

## 5. Data processing

**Input**
- Cleaned data files
- StatCan CSD file

**Output**
- Processed data files
- Logs
  - Summary from each step — what changed
  - Summary before/after filtering. Transparent on rows dropped for what reason

**Workflow**
- Run pipeline orchestrator script to run each stage

**Steps**
- Per provider file, processed concurrently:
  - Apply classifications (using classification mapping file from previous step)
  - Filter unwanted data
  - Calculate lengths along line geometry
  - Assign CSD (using StatCan CSD geometry file)
- Merge — combine all provider files into one dataset
- Deduplication — spatial, across the merged data

**Notes**
- These steps are specific to bikeways. Package should be able to accommodate new steps, or choice to not run certain steps — i.e. modular.
- If some steps are very long, option to produce intermediate data?
- Still missing: final aggregation/output step (summary CSV by municipality, concordance dictionary, metadata dictionary) — TBD

## 6. Data validation

**Input**
- Processed data
- Previous data (optional) — prior vintage's completed output, loaded as a static file (e.g. 2019, 2024), not from a shared/live pipeline
- OSM data (optional)

**Output**
- Pass/fail result
- Logs

**Workflow**
- Run automated sanity checks/tests against the data, report yes/no plus details in the log
- Specific checks TBD

## 7. Data visualization

**Input**
- Data from any pipeline stage (raw through processed) — useful for troubleshooting without a GIS tool, not just final output

**Output**
- Plotly Dash app
  - Map plotting data
    - Click on a point opens tooltip with column: value pairs
    - Tooltip has option to open a Google Street View link from that point (can point externally and open in new tab)
  - Column inspection
    - Number of unique values
    - Type
    - Number of nulls
    - 3 sample points
  - Table view — sort
  - Filtering
    - Apply to map and table?
    - By specified (categorical?) columns
